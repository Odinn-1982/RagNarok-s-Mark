# RagNarok's Mark v4.0 - Features in Plain English

**What This Module Does:** Manages status effects (like "poisoned", "stunned", "blessed") for characters in your Foundry VTT game, but way better than the basic version.

---

## 🎯 THE BIG PICTURE

Instead of manually tracking "John is poisoned for 3 rounds" on paper, this module:
- Tracks it automatically
- Shows visual effects on the character
- Removes it when time's up
- Handles all the complicated rules

---

## ✨ MAIN FEATURES (In Plain English)

### **1. Smart Auto-Application**
**What it means:** The module figures out which conditions to apply automatically.

**Example:** When you cast a spell that poisons someone, it automatically adds "Poisoned" to them. You don't have to remember.

---

### **2. Two Condition Lists**
**What it means:** Each character has TWO lists of conditions - one active, one on hold.

**Example:** Your character is "concentrating" on a spell. You enter an anti-magic zone, so the module puts "concentrating" on pause. When you leave the zone, it turns back on automatically.

---

### **3. Chain Reactions**
**What it means:** One condition can trigger another, which triggers another.

**Example:** "Poisoned" triggers "Weakened" which triggers "Movement Slowed". All three happen automatically in order.

---

### **4. Stacking Rules**
**What it means:** Decides what happens when you get the same condition twice.

**Example:** If you're already poisoned and get poisoned again, does it stack? Get worse? Replace the old one? You decide.

---

### **5. Round Tracking**
**What it means:** Automatically counts down how long conditions last.

**Example:** "Stunned for 3 rounds" becomes "Stunned for 2 rounds" then "1 round" then disappears. No manual counting.

---

### **6. Visual Effects**
**What it means:** Characters glow, sparkle, smoke, or have other visual effects when conditions are active.

**Example:** A poisoned character has green smoke around them. A blessed character glows gold.

---

### **7. Sounds**
**What it means:** Plays sound effects when conditions are added or removed.

**Example:** Healing makes a "chime" sound. Taking poison damage makes a "sizzle" sound.

---

### **8. Information Popups**
**What it means:** Hover over a condition to see exactly what it does.

**Example:** Hover over "Frightened" and it shows: "Can't move closer to source of fear. Disadvantage on ability checks."

---

### **9. Undo Button**
**What it means:** Made a mistake? Undo it.

**Example:** Accidentally marked the wrong character as stunned? Click undo.

---

### **10. Save & Share**
**What it means:** Save your setup and share it with friends.

**Example:** You spent 2 hours setting up conditions for D&D 5e. Save it as "My D&D Setup" and share the file so friends can use it instantly.

---

### **11. Damage Over Time**
**What it means:** Some conditions automatically hurt you each turn.

**Example:** "Burning" does 5 fire damage at the start of your turn, automatically.

---

### **12. Temporary Stat Changes**

**Example:** "Slowed" cuts your movement speed in half. "Paralyzed" prevents all movement.

---

### **14. Action Blocking**
**What it means:** Some conditions prevent you from attacking, casting spells, etc.

**Example:** "Stunned" means you can't take actions or reactions. The module blocks those buttons.

---

### **15. Damage Reduction**
**What it means:** Some conditions make you resistant or immune to damage types.

**Example:** "Fire Shield" makes you immune to fire damage. The module automatically reduces fire damage to 0.

---

### **16. Temporary Immunities**
**What it means:** Become immune to certain conditions temporarily.

**Example:** "Protection from Poison" makes you immune to being poisoned. The module blocks poison conditions from being added.

---

### **17. Concentration Tracking**
**What it means:** Tracks when you're concentrating on a spell.

**Example:** Shows a glowing badge on your character. If you take damage, it automatically prompts for a concentration check.

### **18. Exhaustion Levels**

**Example:** Each level of exhaustion automatically applies the right penalties. At level 6, your character automatically dies.

### **76. Daggerheart Auto-Defeat System (NEW!)**
**What it means:** Special automation for Daggerheart that handles the "Defeated" vs "Dead" distinction.

**How it works:** When anyone (PC, Adversary, or NPC) reaches 0 HP, they're automatically marked as "Defeated" - NOT dead. You then choose if they're actually dead based on the story.

**Example for PCs:** Your ranger drops to 0 HP. Module marks them "Defeated" automatically. Player decides to spend 2 Hope and pop back up with 5 HP. Module removes "Defeated" automatically. Back in the fight!

**Example for Adversaries:** You drop a goblin to 0 HP. Module marks it "Defeated". You decide narratively: "The goblin is knocked out." Leave it as Defeated. OR: "The goblin dies." Click the "☠️ Mark as Dead" button on the token.

**Manual Controls:** Three buttons appear on defeated/dead tokens:
- "☠️ Mark as Dead" - Change Defeated to Dead (narrative choice)
- "💚 Revive (Defeated)" - Bring dead character back to defeated (resurrection prep)
- "✨ Fully Revive" - Remove all death conditions (full resurrection)

**Why this matters:** In Daggerheart, being Defeated doesn't mean you're Dead. PCs can recover, enemies can be captured, death is a choice. This system respects that philosophy while automating the tracking.

## ❓ "BUT WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY MEAN FOR MY GAME?"

### Before This Module:
1. Player casts a poison spell
2. You write on paper: "Goblin poisoned, 3 rounds left"
3. Each round you manually subtract 1
4. You forget to apply the poison damage
5. Player has to remind you the goblin is poisoned
6. You manually roll poison damage
7. Repeat for 5 enemies
8. **Daggerheart:** Someone drops to 0 HP, you forget if they're defeated or dead, chaos ensues

### After This Module:
1. Player casts poison spell
2. Click the goblin, click "Poisoned"
3. **Everything else happens automatically**
4. Poison damage applies each round
5. Green smoke effect shows it's poisoned
6. After 3 rounds, it removes itself
7. You focus on storytelling, not bookkeeping
8. **Daggerheart:** 0 HP = auto "Defeated", you choose if actually dead with one button click

**That's it. That's what this does. It handles the boring tracking stuff so you can focus on the fun parts of running a game.**
